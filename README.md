**Usage**

- First you need to register a Rich Presence application with discord
     
	- Go here https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
     
	- Make a new application **The name of the app will be the main name for the rich presence**

	- Go to Rich Presence and upload some assets.
- Run DogeDRP.exe (it should open a cmd window)
    
	-  If there are any errors from your config file It should report them in the comannd promt
- Go into discord settings and add the DogeDRP.exe as a game

- Discord should automatically change the path of DogeRP.exe to your Discord Rich Presence


- You can edit the config any time while the program is running to change the presence
